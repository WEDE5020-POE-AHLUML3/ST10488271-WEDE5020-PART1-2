## 🌊 Project Overview
This repository contains **Part 2** of the OceanCare Foundation website.  
The project builds on Part 1 by applying **responsive design, accessibility, and modern web styling practices**.  

The aim is to showcase a fully responsive, accessible, and styled website that adapts across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## ✅ Part 2 Summary
- Linked all HTML files to a single external stylesheet (`css/style.css`).  
- Added base CSS reset and `:root` variables for colors, fonts, and spacing.  
- Implemented typography with **Google Fonts (Poppins + Inter)**.  
- Structured layout with **Flexbox**, adapting from desktop → tablet → mobile.  
- Styled navigation with pseudo-classes (`hover`, `focus`, `active`).  
- Designed with a consistent **color palette (brown, green, gray, red)**.  
- Added accessible enquiry form with **labels, placeholders, and validation**.  
- Implemented **responsive images** using `<picture>` and `srcset`.  
- Applied **mobile-first media queries** at `600px`, `900px`, `1200px`.  
- Completed cross-browser testing (Chrome + Firefox).
